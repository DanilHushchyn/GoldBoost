"""Django Admin Configuration

This module defines the admin site configuration for the Django project. It registers
Django models with the admin site to allow for easy management and viewing of data
through the Django admin interface.

Usage:
    To register a model with the admin site, use the `@admin.register()` decorator:

    ```
    @admin.register(ModelName)
    class ModelNameAdminClass(ModelAdmin):
        pass
    ```

For more information on the Django admin site, see the Django documentation:
